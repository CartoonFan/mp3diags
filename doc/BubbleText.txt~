-----------------------------------

The first scan can take a while (40 minutes for 9000 files on an old Athlon64 3500+, but may be similar for newer systems, as the bottleneck is the hard-drive)

If you have a single-core CPU and you need it temporarily for something else, you can use pause / resume

It is OK to press Abort. The files already processed can be used. Next time when scanning / reloading, the process will resume from where it was aborted

-----------------------------------

-----------------------------------

In order for a file to be included by the filter, it has to have at least a note from those in the "Include notes"

To move some files between the "Include" and the "Available" lists, they need to be first selected with the mouse, then one of these 2 buttons should be pressed

If the "Include" list is empty, no filter is applied

These buttons move all the notes

Simply double-clicking on a note in the "Available" list creates a filter that contains only that note

-----------------------------------

In order for a file to be included by the filter, it has to be in one of the "Include folders" or in a subfolder of one

As with the note filter, if the "Include" list is empty, no filter is applied

Simply double-clicking on a folder in the "Available" list creates a filter that contains only that folder

-----------------------------------

Query Discogs for album info and / or cover art

Query MusicBrainz for album info and / or cover art

Copy the value from the first line to the other lines, in selected columns that make sense

Toggle between "assigned" and "non-assigned" states

Paste images or track info (CTRL+V works too)

Edit patterns

See the meaning of the background colors

Press F2 to enter values manually

Drag the column headers to sort the track info sources. A source's priority decreases as it is moved to the right.

-----------------------------------

Navigation buttons skip entries that don't meet the criteria specified in "Filter"

If a result is found, it is possible to save just the image (if there is one), or the full track data

It is possible to manually launch a new search

As data is received from the internet, the status is updated

-----------------------------------

Press this button to assign the new picture to all the tracks, then save

Press this button to assign this picture to all unassigned tracks (in this case, the last 2 tracks)

The current song is Poison Prince, which was assigned image #1, so this image is shown on a darker background

Based on your settings, changes may be saved automatically when going to another album. Otherwise, you'll have to do it manually

Images displayed here:
  - images embedded in MP3s
  - JPG or PNG files in the current directory
  - pasted images
  - pasted image file names
  - images downloaded from Discogs
  - images downloaded from MusicBrainz


-----------------------------------

Extracting info from consistently (an correctly) named files is possible, and may be easier than searching for album data on the Internet. This is achieved by using patterns.

Track number, artist name, song title, album, and rating have been computed from the full file name

Patterns may also be used to extract track info from data pasted from the clipboard

-----------------------------------

As files are processed, their name is added to the list

MP3 Diags doesn't do normalization itself, but relies on an external program. Go to the configuration dialog to see or change the relevant settings.


-----------------------------------

You may keep the original file

Among other things, the selected pattern adds a "-" between the track number and title

You have to define at least a pattern. It makes sense to have different patterns for "single artist" and "various artists" albums. Press on one of them to select it.


-----------------------------------

Switch between "Erase" and "Move if the destination doesn't already exist; erase if it does". Specify a destination folder if you choose the latter option.


-----------------------------------

Several notes are ignored by default

Select notes to move them.

-----------------------------------



Click on the corresponding button to view / edit one of the 4 lists

See how the "Used transformations" list changes

Maximize the window and look at all the descriptions, to get a better understanding of what the various transformations do

-----------------------------------

You may want to adjust the fonts

Configure what should happen with the changed fields

Configure what should happen with the fields whose value is different from the one in the ID3V2 tag (or if no ID3V2 tag exists)

If you want to use the normalization, make sure that this is correct

-----------------------------------

You may want to use this if incorrect names are shown in files using a language other than English

Also used for composers
