I used MP3 Diags on my files and they seem OK. If something wrong happens, chances are an assertion failure will be triggered (there are many asserts), which leads to crashing the program, but not to corrupting MP3 files. I tested most features as I implemented them, but subsequent changes made some of the tests irrelevant, and I didn't repeat them, mostly because of lack of time and of the liberal use of asserts, which should catch most errors. When an assertion failure is triggered, a dialog like this pops up:

Should you encounter something similar, it would be a good idea to let me know about it, so I can fix the error that caused it. I need to know at least the file and the line, but what would really help is a reproducible sequence of events that triggers the assert.

You should use the forums at ttt0 to report bugs, to make suggestions, to request information about how some feature works or how something can be done, as well as just reporting about your experience with MP3 Diags.

You can also write me at inbox.com, where the account name is ciobi. However, most mail that I receive there from unknown addresses goes straight to the "Spam" folder, so I suggest putting 000 at the beginning of the subject, which greatly increases the likelyhood of a message not to be lost.

If for some reason MP3 Diags crashes at startup, you can use the /u parameter to simulate a new install. This doesn't destroy any custom settings, but chances are that you won't be able tu use your last session until some newer version of the program implements a fix for whatever caused the crash.
